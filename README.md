# About calendars-scale
Display Hijri and Gregorian calendars alongside. For example, in the case of a ruler or scale, where the metric (centimeter) and imperial (inches) measurements are shown alongside each other.
Maybe extend this to include other calendar systems too.
Build this using Javascript, and make this available for use on mobile, desktop, and other devices.
Shouldn't need an internet connection to work with the scale.

## Features that could be helpful
* Maybe a zoom facility would be great. With increasing levels of granularity
  * zooming in from years -> months -> days
  * Use the pinch-to-zoom ability to zoom in / out
* default display is current year +- 10 years
  * Can set 1850 or a specific date as the default year
* option to select a specific date (hijri or gregorian)
